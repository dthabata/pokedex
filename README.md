## Pokédex

This project was done based on the [Looqbox FrontEnd Challenge](https://github.com/looqbox/looqbox-frontend-challenge).

#### 🚀 Start

Clone the project to your machine and run `npm install` to install the project's dependencies.
Once done, just hit `npm start` to see the Pokédex on your screen.

#### 📋 Test prerequisites

- Make a dynamic SPA App that shows a list of Pokémons, and search them, using the [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/).
- In the main page you need a search bar and a loaded list of Pokémons (random or just hardcoded);
- Clicking on any Pokémon shows a card/modal/page with that Pokémon's info;
- Searching and pressing enter on the search bar will show the result instead of the list;
- Your app needs at least two different routes.

#### 🛠️ How it was done

- HTML/CSS;
- React was used in the project through functional components, with arrow functions, also using `hooks`;
- Redux Toolkit was applied as suggested;
- The project was created with TypeScript formatting, however, not all objects were typed; I demonstrated how development should be done in the language;
- The API call was made asynchronously;
- Responsiveness was a priority for the entire application;
- No CSS framework was used beyond Styled Components and AntDesign, which was recommended.

#### ✒️ Observations

- Some comments were left on purpose for the test evaluator to read;
